## Projects

### [AI Morning Briefing](https://github.com/kylenewm/ai-morning-briefing)
**Status:** In Review

An automated daily briefing system that delivers personalized AI insights every weekday at 9:30 AM ET. Intelligently curates AI articles, summarizes podcasts, and processes newsletters into a single, digestible morning update.

- Real-time urgent message prioritization via OpenAI
- Batched lower-priority message summaries surfaced every few hours
- Automated task creation in Notion for urgent items

**Planned Features:**
- AI-generated Jira tickets with contextual documentation
- Auto-generated PRDs
- Streamlit dashboard for visual management
